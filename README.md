# Risks_Practising_DesignPatterns
A simple project to implement myself a few design patterns: Builder, Decorator and Command.

I found in the Internet an interesting task to implement. I used this oportunity to practice design patterns.


Using the attached classes (RiskService, Risk, Resource), call the GetRisks method to return a list of Risks.
Your task is to write a class that consumes this list and provides methods to filter it according to the following
rules:
- Find risks owned by Person 5
- Only those risks that that are not ‘Unapproved’.
- All risks that have ‘fire’ in the title.

Solving the problem correctly is important but you should also use this an opportunity to show us how you would
structure a good solution.
We’ve included 3 sample filtering criteria here but it’s likely the user would want to add extra ones as well as
combine them, you should bear this in mind while designing your solution.
You can include as many files as you think are necessary to demonstrate your solution. You should include at
least a completed class file and unit tests to show its correctness.
